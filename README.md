## Question:
Hi All

For tomo lab, you need to complete this playlist @ hostel only. No need to goto CC as you will need to install Git on your laptop
The playlist is :
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9goXbgTDQ0n_4TBzOO0ocPR

Follow the playlist 

Signup on github.com and make a new repo 
ROLL_Lab1 (ROLL in Caps) and write two sample C codes (make a calculator prog and commit every operation & make a prog that implements . Insertion Sort 路 2. Selection Sort 路 3. Bubble Sort 路 4. Merge Sort 路 5. Quick Sort., commit at every sort),  and commit at regular intervals. 
I should at least see 10 commits per student.
